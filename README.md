# WineQualityPrediction
Modeling Machine Learning Models for Wine Quality Prediction using Various Psychochemical Properties 


# Abstract of the project 

## In this project we use Machine Learning Models to predict the quality of wine. Currently the quality is mostly decided by Aroma and Taste of the wine which are sensory data and hence are difficult to quantify. Here we try to use the physicochemical properties of the wine to predict the quality.  After evaluating several machine learning models, three were tuned under computationally efficient procedure for model evaluation and feature selection. This was a tie breaker between XgBoost Classifier, giving highest over all F1 Score and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), achieving most promising results in most precisely predicting the fine quality of wine.
